    "For this project I wanted to create a simple compatibility test based on zodiac sun signs. You type in two people's birth month and birth date as a numerical value and the code would tell you what you and your person's Zodiac Sun Sign is as well as if whether you two are compatible or not. I also included a dictionary of random birthdays to show that the code can generate the compatibility of two random people using their birth date and birth month in a dictionary."

    "Extra Credit:\n",
    "This assignment was tricky to code to make sure all the elements were working. I haven't had any proper coding class before this class as I was only learning how to use \"pseudocode\" versus actual code. This basic understanding helped me organize and outline what I wanted my code to do. I had a tough time importing the .py files initially as I kept making small grammatical errors. After a few trial and errors I was able to make the imported modules run smoothly. I also only originally had the first test cell which allowed a user to input their name and birth date. I added the randomized compatibility generator to make the code more useful and \"fun\". This would also be a good way to have more names and birthdays compiled in an easier way. After talking to the TA John I was able to get more ideas how to make this code more complex. I also originally organized the zodiac_signs module in a more complex way using \"elif\" and \"or\" statements but after talking to the TA again, I was able to simplify it by only using integers to make it more streamlined and easier to look at/read."
